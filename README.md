===========================

Things TO DO:
  1. Make the HTTP Request call and get the JSON object and edit "js/Controller.js" as required

Thing TO ENSURE:
  1. JSON object 
    -  Required to be = {"action":"Start","gesture":"Unlock Gesture"}
    -  Make sure always action start with a CAPITAL
    -  At Lock JSON = {"action":"Lock","gesture":""}
    
  2. At change Configuration (ex: 1, 2, 3), you need to send the signal to the MYO


You can test the system currently by typing the JSON on the placeholder text box,
after you configure it to make the call just hide it.
