===========================

Things TO DO:
  1. Make the HTTP Request call and get the JSON object and edit "js/Controller.js" as required
  2. At change Configuration (ex: 1, 2, 3), you need to send the signal to the MYO

Thing TO ENSURE:
  1. JSON object 
    -  Required to be = {"action":"Start","gesture":"Unlock Gesture"}
    -  Make sure always action start with a CAPITAL
    -  At Lock JSON = {"action":"Lock","gesture":""}

You can test the system currently by typing the JSON on the placeholder text box,
after you configure it to make the call just hide it.
